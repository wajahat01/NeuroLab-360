# Requirements Document

## Introduction

NeuroLab 360 is a full-stack web application designed to provide researchers and scientists with a comprehensive platform for conducting mock neurological experiments and visualizing experimental data through an intuitive dashboard. The system will enable users to authenticate securely, run simulated experiments, store results, and analyze data through interactive visualizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to securely authenticate into the system using my email and password, so that I can access my experimental data and maintain data privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a login page with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using Supabase Auth and redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain their session across browser refreshes
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to view a comprehensive dashboard of my experimental data, so that I can quickly assess my research progress and identify trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a summary of their experiments
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show interactive charts and visualizations of experimental results
3. WHEN data is displayed THEN the system SHALL present it in a clear, organized format with proper labeling
4. WHEN no experiments exist THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message guiding users to create their first experiment
5. WHEN the dashboard is accessed THEN the system SHALL load data efficiently without significant delays

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to run mock neurological experiments, so that I can generate test data and validate my experimental protocols.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the experiments page THEN the system SHALL display available experiment types
2. WHEN a user selects an experiment type THEN the system SHALL present configurable parameters for that experiment
3. WHEN a user initiates an experiment THEN the system SHALL execute the mock experiment and generate realistic data
4. WHEN an experiment completes THEN the system SHALL store the results in the Supabase database
5. WHEN experiment results are generated THEN the system SHALL display them immediately to the user
6. WHEN multiple experiments are run THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of all experimental sessions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to navigate easily between different sections of the application, so that I can efficiently manage my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display a navigation bar with links to Dashboard and Experiments
2. WHEN a user clicks on navigation links THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate page without full page reloads
3. WHEN a user is on any page THEN the system SHALL highlight the current page in the navigation
4. WHEN a user accesses the navigation THEN the system SHALL provide a logout option
5. WHEN the navigation is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the current user's information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the application to have a modern, responsive interface, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a modern, clean interface using TailwindCSS styling
2. WHEN accessed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively
3. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for user actions
4. WHEN data is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate typography and spacing for readability
5. WHEN forms are presented THEN the system SHALL include proper validation and error messaging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to store data reliably in Supabase, so that experimental data is persistent and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN experimental data is generated THEN the system SHALL store it in the Supabase PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL use Supabase Auth for secure user management
3. WHEN data operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle database connections efficiently
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish proper database connections using environment variables

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have a clear separation between frontend and backend, so that the system is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the frontend SHALL be a React application with TailwindCSS
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the backend SHALL be a Flask Python application serving RESTful endpoints
3. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL expose APIs for experiments and dashboard data
4. WHEN frontend components are built THEN the system SHALL follow React best practices with reusable components
5. WHEN the project is structured THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between frontend, backend, and database schema files
