# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical issue of dashboard API failures in the NeuroLab 360 application. The dashboard APIs (`/api/dashboard/summary`, `/api/dashboard/charts`, `/api/dashboard/recent`) are currently failing, preventing users from accessing their experiment data and insights. This fix will ensure reliable API responses, proper error handling, robust data fetching, and graceful degradation when services are unavailable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the dashboard APIs to be reliable and always return valid responses, so that I can consistently access my experiment data and insights without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests dashboard data THEN the system SHALL return a successful response within 5 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN the database is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL return cached data if available or a graceful error message
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return a clear 401 error with actionable guidance
4. WHEN data processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log the error and return partial data where possible
5. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs and handle malformed requests gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want robust error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that temporary issues don't prevent me from accessing my dashboard data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN data aggregation encounters errors THEN the system SHALL return available data and indicate which sections failed
3. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance for token refresh
4. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures
5. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging while returning user-friendly messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API monitoring and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues when dashboard APIs fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log request details, response times, and success/failure status
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture stack traces, user context, and request parameters
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL track response times and identify slow queries
4. WHEN authentication issues arise THEN the system SHALL log authentication attempts and failures
5. WHEN data inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and log the anomalies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the dashboard to gracefully handle partial data and service degradation, so that I can still access available information even when some services are down.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN one dashboard API fails THEN the system SHALL still display data from successful API calls
2. WHEN data is stale or cached THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the data freshness to users
3. WHEN services are degraded THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality and clear status messages
4. WHEN real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to manual refresh options
5. WHEN critical services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate maintenance message with estimated recovery time
