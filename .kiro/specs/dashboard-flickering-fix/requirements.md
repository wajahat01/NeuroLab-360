# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the dashboard flickering issue that occurs after user login in the NeuroLab 360 application. The flickering creates a poor user experience and suggests issues with state management, component rendering, or authentication flow transitions. This fix will ensure a smooth, seamless transition from login to dashboard without visual disruptions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the dashboard to load smoothly after login without any flickering or visual disruptions, so that I have a professional and seamless user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL transition to the dashboard without any visible flickering or flash of content
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display content progressively without showing empty states or loading flickers
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL handle the transition smoothly without re-rendering components unnecessarily
4. WHEN the dashboard is accessed directly with valid authentication THEN the system SHALL load without flickering
5. WHEN components are mounting THEN the system SHALL prevent layout shifts and visual jumps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the authentication state to be managed efficiently, so that there are no delays or visual artifacts during the login-to-dashboard transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication state is being determined THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states without flickering
2. WHEN user session is validated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI state throughout the process
3. WHEN protected routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL handle authentication checks without causing visual disruptions
4. WHEN the authentication context updates THEN the system SHALL prevent unnecessary component re-renders
5. WHEN initial app load occurs THEN the system SHALL handle authentication state initialization smoothly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component rendering to be optimized, so that state changes don't cause unnecessary re-renders and flickering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React components update THEN the system SHALL use proper memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. WHEN data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL maintain stable component structure during loading states
3. WHEN routing occurs THEN the system SHALL prevent flash of incorrect content during navigation
4. WHEN conditional rendering is used THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth transitions between different UI states
5. WHEN CSS is applied THEN the system SHALL prevent layout shifts and visual jumps during component mounting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want consistent loading states across the application, so that I understand when the system is processing and don't experience unexpected visual changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display consistent loading indicators without flickering
2. WHEN components are initializing THEN the system SHALL show skeleton screens or placeholders instead of empty content
3. WHEN async operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL maintain visual stability
4. WHEN error states occur THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly without causing visual disruptions
5. WHEN content appears THEN the system SHALL animate or fade in content rather than showing abrupt changes
