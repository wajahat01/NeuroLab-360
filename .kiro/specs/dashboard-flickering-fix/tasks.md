# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Optimize AuthContext to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Implement memoized AuthContext provider with stable user object reference
  - Add proper initialization state management to track auth loading completion
  - Create useMemo for auth value object to prevent context re-renders on every state change
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Create optimized useAuth hook with memoization
  - Implement useAuth hook that returns memoized values to prevent consumer re-renders
  - Add proper dependency array to useMemo to only update when necessary auth state changes
  - Write unit tests to verify hook doesn't cause unnecessary re-renders
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4_

- [ ] 3. Enhance ProtectedRoute component with proper loading states
  - Modify ProtectedRoute to show skeleton loading state while authentication is being determined
  - Implement proper conditional rendering to prevent flash of login page before auth check completes
  - Add smooth transition handling between loading, authenticated, and unauthenticated states
  - Write tests to verify no flickering occurs during route protection checks
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 4. Create DashboardSkeleton component for stable loading states
  - Implement skeleton component that matches the exact layout structure of the loaded dashboard
  - Add CSS animations for skeleton loading effect using TailwindCSS
  - Ensure skeleton maintains same dimensions and layout as actual content to prevent layout shifts
  - Write visual regression tests to verify skeleton matches actual dashboard layout
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 1.2_

- [ ] 5. Optimize Dashboard component with React.memo and proper state management
  - Wrap Dashboard component with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Implement stable useEffect dependencies to prevent infinite re-rendering loops
  - Add proper loading state management for dashboard data fetching
  - Create memoized callback functions for event handlers to prevent child re-renders
  - Write performance tests to measure render cycle improvements
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 1.1_

- [ ] 6. Implement stable CSS layouts to prevent layout shifts
  - Add fixed grid layout structure to dashboard container using TailwindCSS
  - Implement consistent spacing and dimensions for dashboard cards and components
  - Create CSS classes for smooth fade-in transitions instead of abrupt content appearance
  - Add min-height constraints to prevent vertical layout shifts during content loading
  - Write CSS tests to verify layout stability during content transitions
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 1.5, 4.5_

- [ ] 7. Add error boundaries for graceful error handling
  - Create DashboardErrorBoundary component to catch and handle rendering errors
  - Implement fallback UI that maintains layout structure when errors occur
  - Add error logging and recovery mechanisms for dashboard component failures
  - Write tests to verify error boundaries prevent flickering during error states
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 2.1_

- [ ] 8. Optimize data fetching with proper loading state management
  - Implement stable data fetching hooks that maintain consistent loading states
  - Add proper error handling for API calls that doesn't cause visual disruptions
  - Create optimistic updates for better user experience during data operations
  - Add data caching to prevent unnecessary refetching that causes flickering
  - Write integration tests for smooth data loading transitions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 1.2_

- [ ] 9. Add performance monitoring and visual regression testing
  - Implement React DevTools Profiler integration to monitor component render cycles
  - Create automated visual regression tests using Jest and React Testing Library
  - Add performance benchmarks for login-to-dashboard transition timing
  - Write end-to-end tests using Cypress to verify smooth user experience
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [ ] 10. Implement smooth transition animations
  - Add CSS transition classes for content fade-in effects using TailwindCSS
  - Create consistent animation timing across all dashboard components
  - Implement proper animation cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Add reduced motion support for accessibility compliance
  - Write tests to verify animations don't cause layout shifts or flickering
  - _Requirements: 4.5, 1.1, 1.2_
