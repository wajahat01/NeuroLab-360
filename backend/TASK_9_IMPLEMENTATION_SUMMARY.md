# Task 9: Graceful Degradation Mechanisms - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive graceful degradation mechanisms for the NeuroLab 360 Dashboard API. This implementation provides robust fallback capabilities, service status monitoring, maintenance mode handling, and automatic recovery scenarios to ensure the system remains functional even when individual services experience issues.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Degradation Service (`degradation_service.py`)

**Core Classes:**
- `DegradationService`: Main orchestrator for all degradation functionality
- `MaintenanceMode`: Handles scheduled maintenance with service-specific control
- `FallbackDataProvider`: Provides fallback data when primary services fail
- `ServiceHealthMonitor`: Monitors service health and calculates degradation levels

**Key Features:**
- Service status tracking (Healthy, Degraded, Unavailable, Maintenance)
- Degradation levels (None, Minor, Moderate, Severe, Critical)
- Automatic degradation level calculation based on error counts and response times
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking mechanisms

### 2. Service Management API (`routes/service_management.py`)

**Endpoints Implemented:**
- `GET /api/service/status` - Get service status information
- `GET /api/service/health` - Get detailed service health metrics
- `POST /api/service/maintenance` - Enable maintenance mode (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/service/maintenance` - Disable maintenance mode (admin only)
- `GET /api/service/maintenance` - Get maintenance status
- `PUT /api/service/health/<service>` - Update service health (admin only)
- `POST /api/service/fallback/<data_type>` - Register fallback data (admin only)
- `POST /api/service/test-degradation` - Test degradation scenarios (admin only)
- `GET /api/service/metrics` - Get service performance metrics

**Security Features:**
- Admin authentication required for management operations
- API key-based authentication for sensitive endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization

### 3. Dashboard Integration

**Enhanced Dashboard Routes:**
- Added graceful degradation decorators to all dashboard endpoints
- Integrated maintenance mode checks
- Automatic fallback data provision during service failures
- Service status indicators in API responses

**Decorators Applied:**
- `@with_graceful_degradation('dashboard', 'dashboard_summary')`
- `@maintenance_mode_check('dashboard')`
- Automatic error handling with fallback responses

## Fallback Data Providers

### Static Fallback Data
- Pre-configured fallback data for critical endpoints
- Configurable confidence levels (0.0 to 1.0)
- Timestamp tracking for data freshness

### Generated Fallback Data
- Dynamic fallback data generation using registered functions
- Context-aware fallback (user-specific, parameter-specific)
- Graceful handling of generator failures

### Minimal Data Providers
- `get_minimal_dashboard_summary()`: Empty dashboard with basic structure
- `get_minimal_dashboard_charts()`: Empty charts with proper format
- `get_minimal_recent_experiments()`: Empty experiment list

### Stale Cache Fallback
- Integration with cache service for stale data retrieval
- Automatic fallback to expired cache data during service outages
- Clear indicators when stale data is being served

## Service Status Indicators

### Response Enhancement
All API responses now include service status information when degradation is detected:

```json
{
  "data": { /* normal response data */ },
  "service_degraded": true,
  "service_status": {
    "timestamp": "2025-08-23T20:39:37.412414",
    "maintenance_mode": {
      "enabled": false
    },
    "service_health": {
      "service_name": "dashboard",
      "status": "degraded",
      "degradation_level": "moderate",
      "message": "Service experiencing slow responses"
    }
  }
}
```

### Fallback Response Format
When fallback data is served:

```json
{
  "data": { /* fallback data */ },
  "service_degraded": true,
  "fallback_info": {
    "source": "stale_cache",
    "confidence": 0.7,
    "is_stale": true,
    "message": "Using stale cached data due to service unavailability",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-23T20:39:37.412407"
  },
  "service_status": { /* service status info */ }
}
```

## Maintenance Mode Handling

### Features
- Service-specific maintenance mode (can target individual services)
- Automatic expiration based on duration
- Custom maintenance messages
- Graceful handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (503)

### Usage Example
```python
# Enable maintenance for dashboard service
degradation_service.maintenance_mode.enable(
    message="Scheduled database maintenance",
    duration_minutes=30,
    affected_services=["dashboard"]
)

# Check if service is in maintenance
if degradation_service.maintenance_mode.is_enabled("dashboard"):
    return maintenance_response, 503
```

### API Response During Maintenance
```json
{
  "error": "Service under maintenance",
  "message": "Scheduled database maintenance",
  "maintenance_mode": {
    "enabled": true,
    "message": "Scheduled database maintenance",
    "remaining_minutes": 25,
    "affected_services": ["dashboard"]
  },
  "retry_after": 1500
}
```

## Service Health Monitoring

### Health Metrics Tracked
- **Error Count**: Number of errors in recent time window
- **Response Time**: Average and peak response times
- **Service Status**: Current operational status
- **Degradation Level**: Calculated based on metrics
- **Last Check**: Timestamp of last health update

### Degradation Thresholds
- **Minor**: 5+ errors or 2+ second response times
- **Moderate**: 10+ errors or 5+ second response times  
- **Severe**: 20+ errors or 10+ second response times
- **Critical**: 50+ errors or 30+ second response times

### Overall System Health
- Aggregates health from all monitored services
- Overall status reflects worst individual service status
- Overall degradation level reflects highest individual degradation

## Error Handling Integration

### Service Failure Scenarios
1. **Database Errors**: Automatic fallback to cached data
2. **Network Timeouts**: Retry with exponential backoff
3. **Circuit Breaker Open**: Immediate fallback without retry
4. **Validation Errors**: Graceful error messages with recovery suggestions

### Response Codes
- **200**: Normal operation
- **206**: Partial content (fallback data served)
- **503**: Service unavailable (maintenance or critical failure)

## Testing Implementation

### Unit Tests (`test_degradation_service.py`)
- **29 test cases** covering all degradation functionality
